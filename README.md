# image-reveal-game
Game with a purpose for image recognition (NETS 213 Final Project)

## Planning (1 point) 
In planning phase of our project, we expect to lay out the guidelines for Task 1 (annotation) and Task 2 (guessing), including the instructions that the user will see. We will also be selecting and inputting a relevant image dataset, setting goals for the size and attributes of our HIT's outputs, and establishing a budget and timeline for our milestones. 

## Task 1: Annotation (8 total points) 
Our first task for the crowdworkers is annotating images. To do this, a crowdworker will be given a clear version of an image, a blurred version of the same image, and a label associated with the image. For example, the label could be 'dog' and the image would be one containing a dog somewhere within it. The annotator's role is to click on pixelated squares of the blurred image to make that square clear, with the goal being to reveal the label in as few clicks as possible.
